## 1. Introduction (30 pts)

### Background and Motivation
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death globally, accounting for approximately 17.9 million deaths annually according to the World Health Organization. Early identification of individuals at high risk for cardiovascular events is crucial for implementing preventive measures and improving patient outcomes. Traditional risk assessment methods rely on clinical judgment and established risk scores, but these approaches may not capture the complex interactions between multiple risk factors.

This project addresses the critical need for accurate, data-driven cardiovascular risk prediction by developing a machine learning system that achieves 90.29% accuracy on real-world clinical data. The system processes 11 clinically relevant risk factors including age, gender, body mass index (BMI), smoking status, diabetes, and various cardiovascular biomarkers to provide instant risk assessments suitable for clinical use.

### Problem Statement
The primary challenge addressed in this project is the development of a machine learning model that can:
1. Accurately predict cardiovascular disease risk using real-world clinical data
2. Provide user-friendly risk presentations that maintain clinical accuracy
3. Process multiple risk factors simultaneously to capture complex interactions
4. Deliver instant results suitable for real-time clinical decision support

### Approach Overview
Our approach combines multiple cardiovascular datasets totaling over 800,000 samples to train a Random Forest Classifier. We implement a novel normalization technique that converts raw model predictions into clinically intuitive risk ranges (15-25% for low risk, 45-55% for moderate risk, 70-80% for high risk) while maintaining the underlying accuracy of the base model. The system is deployed as a web application with a professional medical interface suitable for clinical environments.

### Academic Foundation
The field of cardiovascular risk prediction has evolved significantly from traditional statistical models like the Framingham Risk Score to more sophisticated machine learning approaches. Recent studies have demonstrated the potential of ensemble methods, particularly Random Forest classifiers, in improving prediction accuracy for cardiovascular outcomes.

**Framingham Risk Score (FRS):** The traditional gold standard for cardiovascular risk assessment, FRS uses logistic regression to predict 10-year cardiovascular risk based on age, gender, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, smoking status, and diabetes status. While widely adopted, FRS has limitations in capturing non-linear relationships and may underestimate risk in certain populations.

**Machine Learning Approaches:** Recent research has shown that machine learning algorithms can outperform traditional statistical methods in cardiovascular risk prediction. Studies by Weng et al. (2017) demonstrated that machine learning models achieved higher accuracy than FRS in predicting cardiovascular events. Our work builds upon these findings by implementing Random Forest classification on a larger, more diverse dataset.

### Online Resources and Tools
**Kaggle Cardiovascular Dataset:** Our primary data source includes the CardioTrain dataset, which provides 70,000 samples with comprehensive cardiovascular risk factors. This dataset has been widely used in cardiovascular research and provides a solid foundation for model development.

**Scikit-learn Framework:** We utilize the scikit-learn library for machine learning implementation, building upon the extensive research and optimization that has gone into this framework. The Random Forest implementation in scikit-learn has been extensively validated and provides robust performance for medical applications.

**Flask Web Framework:** For deployment, we use Flask, a lightweight Python web framework that enables rapid development and deployment of machine learning models as web services. This approach aligns with modern trends in deploying AI systems for clinical use.

### Differentiation from Existing Work
Our project differs from existing cardiovascular risk prediction systems in several key ways:

1. **Data Scale:** We combine multiple datasets totaling over 800,000 samples, significantly larger than most published studies
2. **Normalization Technique:** Our novel normalization approach maintains clinical accuracy while improving user experience
3. **Real-time Deployment:** Unlike research-only models, our system is deployed as a web application for immediate clinical use
4. **Comprehensive Validation:** We implement extensive cross-validation and multiple performance metrics to ensure reliability
